# Census API
The four packages we need are *tidycensus*, *tigris*, *tmap*,and *tidyverse*. *Tidycensus* is the package we will use to access the US Census and gather data, and *tidyverse* is the package we will use to merge and tidy the data.

Before you begin, you will need a Census API key. You can obtain one through the Census website located here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html.
