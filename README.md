# Census API
Before you begin, you will need a Census API key. You can obtain one through the Census website located here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html.

This example uses the *tidycensus* method to access the Census API. The code and walkthrough are available in the Quarto document within this repository. 

The document will show you how to pull data from the Census API using *tidycensus* by showing an example. This tutorial isn't a complete walkthrough on how to use *tidycensus*, and doesn't highlight how to find variables or census tables. To find more information on that, please visit https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html.
